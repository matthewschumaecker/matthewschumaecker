- 👋 Hi, I’m @matthewschumaecker
  
- I am a <a href="https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/matthew-m-schumaecker-md">cardiologist at Carilion Clinic</a> in Roanoke, VA with a passion for health informatics, health analytics and artificial intelligence
- My major development projects surround the use of generative AI in cardiology education and case summarization.
- I also offer a cardiology calculator that is free of ads at <a href="https://corcalc.io">corcalc.io</a>
- I indulge my inner nerd by experimenting with Linux-hosted open-source LLMs and fine-tuning my Neovim setup.
  
- I also like bagels .... a lot.
