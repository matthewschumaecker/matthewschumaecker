ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @matthewschumaecker

I'm a <a href="https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/matthew-m-schumaecker-md">cardiologist at Carilion Clinic in Roanoke, VA</a> with a deep interest in health informatics, analytics, and AI.

My development work focuses on generative AI for cardiology education and clinical case summarization.

I maintain a free, ad-free cardiology calculator at <a href="http://corcalc.io">corcalc.io.</a>

I indulge my inner nerd by running open-source LLMs on Linux and fine-tuning my Neovim setup.

Also, I really like bagels.
